      <h2>Arianne Mae R. Apolinario</h2>
      <p>I am a fourth-year Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in pursuing web development. Earlier this year, I made the decision to relearn coding from HTML, a first hands-on coding experience I've been taught in my journey with Computer.</p>
      <p>While practicing, I discovered FreeCodeCamp, which introduced me to CSS and helped me understand how these tools apply to real projects. One of the exercises, creating a magazine layout through CSS Grid, inspired me to build a webpage dedicated to my favorite artist, 2PM. It’s still a work in progress, but it has been a great hands-on learning experience.</p>
      <p>In one of my CPE courses which is Practice and Design course, I was also assigned to develop the Flask-based UI for an OTP and fingerprint authentication system for gym members. The system integrates touchscreen interaction, fingerprint scanning, and OTP verification to ensure secure access. Working on this project made me realize how much I enjoy building user-focused and functional web applications.</p>
      <p>I may be restarting my coding journey with HTML and CSS, but if given the opportunity, I’m confident that I can quickly learn and grow.</p>
